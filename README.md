# StudentDataAnnalysis

# This project contains the Python script to generate a CSV modeled on the Heriot-Watt University student data base shape. The purpose of the synthetic data is to model specific scenarios in a Neo4j Graph Database for evaluation of different tools and queries that could be applied to the real data to extract meaningful conclusions.

This project was written using the Pycharm IDE.
